Features Selection
=====================

The tools allowing you to select features in the visualization window are regrouped in the :guilabel:`Selection` menu:

  * :guilabel:`Select` (:kbd:`V`): select one or more object in the current layer in edition
  * :guilabel:`Select by Feature ID...`: select an object with its ID
  * :guilabel:`Clear Selection` (:kbd:`Ctrl+D`): clear the current selection
  * :guilabel:`Invert Selection`: unselect the current selection and select all non selected objects

Single Selection
--------------------

Regardless you want to make a simple or a multiple selection, you have to be in edition of the correct construction layer to target an object.

You have two ways to select a unique feature:

  * By using the selection tool: Activate the selection tool by clicking on it in the toolbar or by selecting it in the menu :guilabel:`Selection`. Then simply clik on the object you want to select in the visualization window.
  * By using the :guilabel:`Select by Feature ID...` tool: Every object in a ToolMap project has a unique ID, you can also select a precise object if you know its ID.

Multiple Selection
--------------------

The multiple selection is made with the selection tool. You can either click and drag your cursor to select all the features within the rectangle or by selecting single features one by one maintaining the Shift key.
